 quantification. It consists of qPLEX-RIME data of 10 samples
 divided into three conditions (FA, DSG.FA and IgG).}

\description{
An ER qPLEX-RIME experiment was performed to compare two different ways of cell crosslinking. 
MCF7 cells were double crosslinked with DSG/formaldehyde (double) or with formaldehyde alone 
(single). Four biological replicates were obtained for each condition along with two IgG pooled 
samples from each replicate.
