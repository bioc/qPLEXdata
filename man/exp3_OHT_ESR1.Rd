\format{An object of class \code{\link{list}} related to peptides
  quantification. It consists of qPLEX-RIME data from three experimental
  runs. Each run contains 10 samples divided into five conditions (IgG, vehicle,
  tam.2h, tam.6h and tam.24h).}

\description{
Three ER qPLEX-RIME (10plex) experiments were performed to 
investigate the dynamics of the ER complex assembly upon 
4-hydrotamoxifen (OHT) treatment at 2h, 6h and 24h or at 24h
post-treatment with the drug-vehicle alone (ethanol). Two 
biological replicates of each condition were included in 
each experiment to finally consider a total of six replicates
per time point. Additionally, MCF7 cells were treated with OHT 
or ethanol and cross-linked at 24h post-treatment in each 
experiment to be used for mock IgG pull-downs and to enable 
discrimination of non-specific binding in the same experiment.
This is a timecourse experiment to study the effect of tamoxifen 
in ER interactome using qPLEX-RIME method.
